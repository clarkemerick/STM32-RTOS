This example project shows how you can detect glitches using
the Logic Analyzer in the µVision Simulator.  Glitches are an
effect of I/O port settings. The increase dramatically the EMC 
behaviour of electronic equipment and are often hard to detect.

When using the uVision Logic Analyzer these glitches are easy
to see in the Logic Analyzer Window when you select the display 
types:

- State: which shows a signal as a state diagram
- Bit:   that shows just a single I/O pin value
